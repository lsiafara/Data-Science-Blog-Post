## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I am using the [Stack Overflow survey data - 2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) to answer the following questions:

1. What are the top paying languages?
2. What are the top paying positions?
3. What factors are important while chosing a job, other than salary and location?



## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook with the code used to answer the above questions.
There is an additional `.py` file that contains the helper functions to obtain the results.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@lydia.siafara/3-ways-to-level-up-your-career-as-developer-and-increase-your-job-satisfaction-595fc39afbd0).
